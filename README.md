# Visual-Analytics-Assignment-2

Hello,

To assess my assignment you should download the .ipynb-script in this repository. This can be done manually by going through the following steps:

1: Open the "image_search.ipynb" file in this repository.

2: Press "raw" in the top right corner.

3: Save the file as an .ipynb-file (windows: ctrl + s // mac: cmd + s).

4: Upload this to your "src" or "notebooks" folder in Jupyter notebook.

5: Make sure that you have the unzipped img-folder in your data-folder.

6: Open the script and run it.
